Distributed, fault-tolerant and fast Debian repository with REST API and pluggable storage modules.

IDEA:
-----
A common use case for internal (and some public) debian repos is to store packages in several environments (for example, unstable -> testing -> stable) and move them as they getting stabilized. Cacus encourages this approach by own design and features, although it's not mandatory. 
Moreover, cacus is designed for high-load and high-availability environments, relying on MongoDB and various storage engines and can be easily installed and used on multiple instances behind any kind of load balancing. 
Also, besides CLI interface cacus features handy REST API that can be used to integrate it with CI systems.

INSTALLING:
-----------
Get the code, install the dependencies:
Python libs (via pip or apt):
- pymongo
- motor
- tornado
- pyinotify
- requests
- pyme
- yapsy
- concurrent.futures
- python-debian (>= 0.1.21+nmu3 for .xz compression support in .deb)

Debian packages:
- mini-dinstall (it's not actually used as repo manager, just one python lib)

Also you will need MongoDB running somewhere, and storage:
- Dummy local file storage - ready to use
- Elliptics (http://reverbrain.com/elliptics/) - planned
- Amazon S3 (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - planned
- Ceph (http://ceph.com) - planned
- Any other - feel free to contribute your storage plugin

Human-friendly ways (debian package, docker image etc) pending.

USAGE:
------
Just run ```python cacus.py --help```

To start incoming dirs watcher, run
```shell
python cacus.py --config /path/to/cacus.yaml --duploader-daemon
```

Start repository HTTP daemon:
```shell
python cacus.py --config /path/to/cacus.yaml --repo-daemon
```
Import repository:
```shell
python cacus.py --config /path/to/cacus.yaml  --import-repo /path/to/repo/ --repo REPO --env ENV
```
